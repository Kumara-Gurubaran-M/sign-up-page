## Introduction

The Sign Up Form is a basic web form designed to capture user information such as full name, email, and password for creating an account. It includes input fields for each piece of information along with corresponding icons for visual representation. Additionally, the form provides a "Sign-Up" button for submission and an option for users to log in if they already have an account.

- Validation to ensure all required fields are filled before submission.
